-Administrator users:
	can remove tweets and user accounts. (User accounts are not delete, but the password is updated in order to don't allow user access)
	There is no option in the application to set a user as an admin.
	These users are created directly on database.
	An administrator user is:
		username: unityword
		password: http://localhost:8080/#1A

	But if you want to set some user as administrator, execute the following query (enter the username in the WHERE clause):
		UPDATE lab2.app_user SET is_admin=true WHERE username='';
